#### Slide 1 – Decoding Microsoft Copilot: The Enterprise Decision Matrix

Summary:
The deck frames Copilot licensing as a strategic enterprise decision, distinguishing between consumer AI and enterprise-grade transformation capabilities.

#### Slide 2 – Three Distinct Products Share One Confusing Name

Summary:
“Copilot” represents three fundamentally different products (Consumer, Lite, Full Enterprise) with different audiences, costs, and capabilities.

#### Slide 3 – True Productivity Requires Deep Application Integration

Summary:
Enterprise productivity gains occur only when Copilot operates inside Microsoft 365 apps, not just through browser-based chat.

#### Slide 4 – Elevating Communication from Basic Chat to Intelligent Management

Summary:
Lite supports simple chat, while Full Enterprise enables contextual meeting recaps, action tracking, and intelligent email drafting within Teams and Outlook.

#### Slide 5 – The Intelligence Difference: Web vs. The Graph

Summary:
Without Microsoft Graph grounding, AI responses are generic; with Graph integration, outputs are context-aware and aligned to company data.

#### Slide 6 – The “Complex Workflow” Stress Test

Summary:
Consumer fails and Lite struggles in multi-step business workflows; only Full Enterprise seamlessly connects SharePoint, Outlook, and Office apps.

#### Slide 7 – Defining the Security Boundary

Summary:
Enterprise AI requires tenant-level data isolation and protection, which only Full Enterprise provides.

#### Slide 8 – If You Can’t Audit It, You Can’t Deploy It

Summary:
Regulated industries require audit logs, retention, and Purview integration — capabilities fully available only in Full Enterprise.

#### Slide 9 – Control and Extensibility

Summary:
Full Enterprise uniquely supports DLP, Sensitivity Labels, and custom AI agents grounded in organizational data.

#### Slide 10 – The Strategic Comparison Matrix

Summary:
The real differentiators are integration, Graph access, governance, and compliance — not just pricing.

#### Slide 11 – Matching the License to the Value

Summary:
The business case for Full Enterprise is driven by integration with Microsoft Graph and Office apps, where enterprise work and ROI are created.
